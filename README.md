## Summary of Lab
In this lab we learned how to combine logic gates to create a more complex output that takes more than one led to understand. 
We also worked again with modules and implementing them in the top file.

## Lab Questions
### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?
You might add more than two bits together by continuing  to add adder gates with the carry and inputs similarly to how we went from one bit to two bits.

### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?
The importance of XOR is to determine if the bit ends up being a 1 or a 0. XOR works so that if they are both 1 then the output will be 0 which is when we would havea carry to the next addition.

### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when
you go over?
The largest number a 2 bit adder can handle is 3. When you go over this number it will show a carry but not be able to display that within the bits. You can deduce that the value would be higher because of the carry being lit up.
